This test case provides an example of an app that has only
one screen that is always "bumpable". The use case is to 
bump with someone, do some quick tasks and disconnect with
that person. The screen should immediately return to being
bumpable so it can bump someone else.

This app specifically also handles backgrounding (take 
a look at the app delegate class) such that when the app
is taken into the background it will disconnect from the
API services and reconnect and be ready to go when coming
back from background. This has been tested over long 
periods of background and is the recommended way to handle
backgrounding.
